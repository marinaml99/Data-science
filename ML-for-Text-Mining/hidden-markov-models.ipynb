The probability to stay in the state 1 is almost one (0.999218078035812) because most of the time we are going to have a next character that is also in the header. The only exception to this case is the point of transition, that happens only one time and is represented by the probability 0.000781921964187974. As being in the state 2 also means that we cannot change our state, the probability of changing from 2 to 1 is 0, while the one to stay in state 2 is always 1."
